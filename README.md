HVSRInv is a MATLAB-based graphical user interface developed for forward calculation and inversion of horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio. This code uses the equivalent linear approach based on the viscoelastic Kelvin-Voigt model to compute the theoretical site response of the horizontally stratified soil layers. Furthermore, the developed graphical user interface can easily estimate the dynamic parameters such as thickness, shear wave velocity, density and damping ratio of the soil layers through an elitist genetic algorithm, and thereby obtain the shear wave velocity profiles.
